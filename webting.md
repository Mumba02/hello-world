		<h1>Water be Gone</h1><hr><br>
		<h2>Question</h2>
		<p>		Does an increase in thickness of a napkin directly increase its absorbency?</p><br><hr><br>
		<h2>Research</h2>
		<p>		One previous study&nbsp(<a href="http://www.wisebread.com/the-5-best-paper-napkins">Wise Bread: The 5 Best Paper Napkins</a>)&nbspthat found that that the more expensive the napkin was, the better it preformed when pitted up against other, cheaper options.  However, through observation we found that the napkins that were more expensive were also found to be thicker and larger in overall volume.</p><br><hr><br>
		<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
		<p>		A 10 by 10cm cut out of the napkin that is the thickest will absorb more water than a 10 by 10cm cut out of thinner napkins.</p><br><hr><br>
		<h2>Experiment</h2>
